# Airport 
Automatic Airport Landing System (Python, Sockets, SQL)

Built a clientâ€“server simulation of an automated landing system for two runways, handling up to 100 aircraft in a 3D airspace.

Implemented airplane clients and the control server with real-time communication via Python sockets. Each client is handled in a separate thread.

Client asks for connection, and send his coordinate. Aiport(server) take control over the client and lead to landing. 

Designed Database in PostgreSQL. Information about all Planes and occured Colissions.
